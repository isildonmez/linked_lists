## Introduction

In Computer Science one of the most basic and fundamental data structures is the linked list, which functions similarly to an array. The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can easily be inserted or removed without reallocation of any other elements.

In some programming languages the size of an array is a concern and one of the ways to overcome that problem and allow dynamically allocated data is using linked lists.

Luckily in **Ruby** arrays aren’t limited to a certain size, so you don’t have to think about overcoming that limitation.

So if array size is not a limitation in Ruby, are linked lists really necessary? The short answer to that is *no*; however, it’s the simplest of the dynamic data structures and it will give you a solid foundation, so you can understand more complex data structures like graphs and binary trees with more ease.

## Structure of a Linked List

A *linked list* is a linear collection of data elements called nodes that “point” to the next node by means of a pointer.

Each node holds a single element of data and a link or pointer to the next node in the list.

A head node is the first node in the list, a tail node is the last node in the list. Below is a basic representation of a linked list:

```
[ NODE(head) ] -> [ NODE ] -> [ NODE(tail) ] -> nil
```

## Assignment

You will need two classes:

1. `LinkedList` class, which will represent the full list.
2. `Node` class, containing a `#value` method and a link to the `#next_node`, set both as `nil` by default.
Build the following methods in your linked list class:

1. `#append` adds a new node to the end of the list
2. `#prepend` adds a new node to the start of the list
3. `#size` returns the total number of nodes in the list
4. `#head` returns the first node in the list
5. `#tail` returns the last node in the list
6. `#at(index)` returns the node at the given index
7. `#pop` removes the last element from the list
8. `#contains?` returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
9. `#find(data)` returns the index of the node containing data, or nil if not found.
10. `#to_s` represent your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: `( data ) -> ( data ) -> ( data ) -> nil`

### Extra Credit

1. `#insert_at(index)` that inserts the node at the given index
2. `#remove_at(index)` that removes the node at the given index. (You will need to update the links of your nodes in the list when you remove a node.)
